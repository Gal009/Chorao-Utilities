- Gives negative effects when someone walks in the SCP-173 tantrum
- Lets you edit SCP-096's AHP and maximum life when it's in rage
- Makes a message appear for SCP-096 when he goes into rage
- Makes a message appear for the SCP-096 when he's calming down
- A message also appears for those who looked at the SCP-096 and gives them the effect of panic
- A message appears that the person is being corroded when stepping on the SCP-173 tantrum
- Gives the coke effect to the SCP-173

Everything I mentioned above is configurable (minus the panic effect, the effect of the SCP-207 that the SCP-173 gets when it puts a tantrum and the negative effects of when someone walks in its tantrum. The only thing you can configure from these Effects is time but if you want I can try to make you change the effects too)

I know that the code is not very good (But i tried to do something good)
you have any suggestions of things to add, you can DM me then on discord: Gal.#3167

(Shout out to Jeppe Beier for the exiled plugin tutorial)
