- Gives negative effects when someone walks in the SCP-173 tantrum
- Lets you edit SCP-096's AHP when it's in rage and the shield recharge rate
- Makes a message appear for SCP-096 when he goes into rage
- Makes a message appear for the SCP-096 when he's calming down
- A message also appears for those who looked at the SCP-096 and gives them the effect of panic
- A message appears that the person is being corroded when stepping on the SCP-173 tantrum
- Gives the coke effect to the SCP-173 when it places the tantrum
- When 939 bites it gives the bleeding effect or the poisoned effect depending on the type of 939

Everything I mentioned above is configurable (minus the panic effect, the effect of the SCP-207 that the SCP-173 gets when it puts a tantrum and the negative effects of when someone walks in its tantrum. The only thing you can configure from these Effects is time and the intensity of the SCP-207 effect but if you want I can try to make you change the effects too)

I know that the code is garbage (But i TRIED to do something good)
you have any suggestions of things to add, you can DM me then on discord: Gal.#3167

(Shout out to Sexiled Contributer for helping me and Jeppe Beier for the exiled plugin tutorial)
